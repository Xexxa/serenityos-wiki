**SerenityOS Wiki**

Welcome to Serenity OS wiki pages.

This project is community-driven, much like SerenityOS itself, with the mission to gather as much information as possible that could help newcomers to learn everything they need to know about this operating system and experienced participants that need to refresh their memory with information they either forgot about or would like to reference for advice.

*The SerenityOS is in constant development, any information/documentation here might be out of date. Please feel free to make a pull request to correct the error or open a new issue if that is the case*
